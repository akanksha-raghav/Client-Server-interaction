## Modules in Python
1. Socket
2. OS
3. Requests
4. TQDM
5. Time

### Socket Module
The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Python’s object-oriented style: the socket() function returns a socket object whose methods implement the various socket system calls.
Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
Python’s socket module provides an interface to the Berkeley sockets API. 

### OS Module
<b>The OS module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS, comes under Python's standard utility modules.</b>
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. The *os* and *os. path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.

### Request Module
The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.
The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

## tqdm
tqm means "Progress" .In addition to its low overhead, tqdm uses smart algorithms to predict the remaining time and to skip unnecessary iteration displays, which allows for a negligible overhead in most cases.
tqdm works on any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris/SunOS), in any console or in a GUI, and is also friendly with IPython/Jupyter notebooks.

## time
The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
