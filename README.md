### Socket Module
The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Python’s object-oriented style: the socket() function returns a socket object whose methods implement the various socket system calls.
Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
Python’s socket module provides an interface to the Berkeley sockets API. 

### OS Module
<b>The OS module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS, comes under Python's standard utility modules.</b>
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. The *os* and *os. path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.
